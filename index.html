     <h1>Inequality: pay gap</h1>

     <div class="paragraph">
          <p>
               We decided to choose a topic that affects people in both countries. 
               As students that are soon to be graduates we decided to focus on
               workspace inequality. Specifically we are going to be talking about
               the pay gap between men and women. 
          </p>

          <h2 class="white">Why is it important to talk about this issue?</h2>

          <div class="paragraph white div1">
               <p>
                    Despite numbers showing that the gender pay gap is still a reality
                    to this day, many misconceptions persist. The only way to ensure
                    people are paid based on their qualifications and job description
                    rather than something they cannot change such as their gender or
                    race is by combating ignorance. Therefore, it is important to open
                    the conversation so that we can dispel myths and face the problem 
                    head on.
               </p>

          <h2 class="white">How will we start the conversation?</h2>

          <div class="paragraph white">
               <p>
                    We want to raise awareness about this inequality through the
                    videos we made, you can find them below. The first video is about
                    a group of friends who get together in a video call to catch up. But
                    when they start talking about their jobs they quickly realize that
                    there is a big difference between how much money the men and
                    the women earn. It's a more playful video, but don't be fooled by
                    that because it has a powerful message. The second video is a
                    short documentary which shows that the wage gap is a global
                    problem. We did this by compiling 4 interviews with people from
                    both Belgium and Mexico.
